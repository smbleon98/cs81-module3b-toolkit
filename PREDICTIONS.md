Function 1: Double
I expect the double function to multiply the number provided by the user by 2. 
If the code is missing a call to the function, we won't see anything in the console; the only thing running will be the function creation and definition.

Function 2: Square
I expect the square function to multiply the number provided by the user by itself. All numbers, whether negative or positive, should produce a positive number.

Function 3: isEven
I expect the isEven function to return the boolean value true if the number is actually even and false if odd.

Function 4: isOdd
I expect the isOdd function to return the boolean value true if the number is actually odd and false if even.


Function 5: multiply
I expect this to return the product of two numbers. Given how flexible JS seems to be, I expect that product will be the appropriate data type. For example,if I multiply a floating number with an integer, I think it will assume the data type that has more decimal places.

Result: My prediction was not accurate. I multiplied -5.5 by 2 and expected -11.0, but instead, it produced -11.


Function 6: I expect this to return the quotient of two numbers. I expect that answer will be the appropriate data type. For example, if I divide a floating number by an integer, the quotient will assume the data type that has more decimal places (so float).
