1. What patterns or surprises did you notice?
- The data type that is chosen in the final answer is not always consistent. For example, float by integer multiplication produced an integer, but float by integer division produced a float. My takeaway is that the remainder plays a role in whether the answer produced is an integer or a float. If no remainder, then integer; otherwise, float.

2. What logic challenged your thinking?
- At times, my isEven and isOdd function definition felt longer than it needed to have been. Even vs. odd are two sides of the same coin essentially, so, I would combine these into one function. Rather than producing true / false for each even and odd, I could have produced "even" or "odd" instead. 

3. How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
- This assignment focused on basic operations, so these can be used to build a calculator-type program. I think a toolkit like this might be helpful for tasks that you have to do repeatedly, like data cleaning and tranforming of raw data exports to produce client-facing program summary reports.
